The green dashed line is an estimate of the local background that is used to test all candidate local maxima against a threshold defined by the red dashed line. This line is calculated as the (median of the background values) + `f` * (median deviation of the background values). The factor `f`    is a user parameter and defaults to 2. The solid blue, orange and green line under the curves indicate the local span of each of the bands and indicate which part of the signal is integrated.\n",
